MAYBE ENCRYPTION FOR PASSWORD

$password = $_POST['password'];

$salt = "8dC_9Kl?";

$encrypted password = md5($password . $salt);

 

The encrypted password would be stored in the database. Then, if you wanted to log the user in and compare what they entered against the database:

 

$db_password = ""; //get the password from the database

if (md5($password . $salt) == $db_password)

{

// continue...

}
